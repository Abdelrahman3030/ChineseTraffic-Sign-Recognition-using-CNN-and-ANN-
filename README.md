This Python script tackles the task of traffic sign recognition using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project leverages the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to build, train, and evaluate both models. The dataset, loaded from a CSV file containing annotations and image file paths, is preprocessed using image augmentation techniques. The CNN model utilizes a pre-trained MobileNetV2 as its base, fine-tuning it for traffic sign classification. On the other hand, the ANN model is constructed from scratch with dense layers. The script provides a comprehensive analysis, including training/validation accuracy and loss plots, confusion matrices, and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Users can explore and compare the effectiveness of CNN and ANN for traffic sign recognition in real-world scenarios. The repository serves as a practical example of deep learning applied to image classification tasks, offering insights into model evaluation and comparison.
